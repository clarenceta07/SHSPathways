            <h2>What is IB?</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>IB, otherwise known as International Baccalaureate, is a strenuous two-year program in which students will take higher-level courses and work towards an IB Diploma. Students that want to apply to the IB program at Seminole High School must apply early during 8th-grade applications to high schools. If you are currently in Sanford Middle’s Pre-IB program, then you will be better prepared for the high school version. The first two years of IB in high school are considered Pre-IB or Pre-DP, meaning that students are not officially in the IB program, but are taking prerequisite classes to be in the official program in their junior and senior years. The IB program requires a student to take 3 HL and 3 SL courses, complete CAS activities, complete the TOK course and write a 4,000-word extended essay(EE). As you could tell from just some of the requirements for the diploma, IB is not a program for everybody. Completing the entirety of the program is a feat anyone should be proud of accomplishing. The IB program is a humbling experience for some in that it will easily be one of the hardest periods of your student life. Many students have different opinions on the program but most agree that it takes hard work and dedication to graduate with an IB Diploma. The key to passing in IB is not having a high IQ or being a genius, but rather effectively using your time to get ahead of your work. Staying ahead gives you free time to enjoy high school and momentum for success. It is imperative to realize that IB should never be your sole spark on your college application, but rather a major part of your credibility as a student. Make sure to spice up your application with extracurriculars YOU are interested in, not what colleges are interested in. Personal hobbies and activities are much more exciting and enjoyable than the same textbook clubs students do to “get into a good college”.</p>

            <div class="ib-pros">
                <p>Pros: </p>
                <ul class="bullet-points">
                    <li>Universities, especially international ones, love to see an IB Diploma on students’ applications.</li>
                    <li>Both the Pre-IB and IB programs prepare you for higher-level learning such as college.</li>
                    <li>The culture of IB is very enclosed, almost like a large family.</li>

            <div class="ib-cons">
                <p>Cons: </p>
                <ul class="bullet-points">
                    <li>All four years of Pre-IB and IB are difficult and will take up a majority of your free time.</li>
                    <li>You need to get used to seeing the same hundred kids in your classes every year.</li>
                    <li>IB has a reputation for stressing students out to the point of dropping out of the program, so do not be too disappointed if IB is not for you.</li>

            <h2>What to Expect in the Beginning</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>The first thing all incoming freshmen need to know is that the IB program is difficult at the start, and only becomes harder each year. Most freshmen will have the choice to take AP courses and will usually have a Pre-DP(Pre-IB) English class, science class, and foreign language class. Your freshman English class will build your analysis and writing skills by reading and analyzing multiple works of writing throughout the year. You will learn how to formally write for your future essays and use the skills you learned in essays during the course. Generally, freshman year in IB is fairly easy for those who manage their time, and this is the time for students to explore what extracurriculars they want to do during high school.</p>
