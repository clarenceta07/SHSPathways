                <p>This is a tier list for all AP classes offered at Seminole High School except for AP Drawing Portfolio Studio(could not get a response). Some of the more obscure courses may have only had a couple responses, so the course could be subjective to the student. However, most of the more popular ones represent students well.

In a survey students listed their most favorite APs as AP Psychology, AP World History, AP Lang, AP Human Geograph, and AP Computer Science Principles. The students listed their least favorite APs as AP Human Geography and AP World History. The reason some classes overlap is due to the popularity and large disparity between surveyed students.
                    
Some APs you could consider taking freshman year is AP Human Geography or AP Computer Science Principles. The more APs you do, the more college credit you will receive.
                    
Some of the easier AP classes are AP Human Geography, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Psychology, AP Macroeconomics, and AP Microeconomics. Some of the harder ones are all the AP Physics courses, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Calc BC, and AP Calc AB.</p>
