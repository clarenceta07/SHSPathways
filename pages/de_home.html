            <h2>What is Dual Enrollment?</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Dual Enrollment is a program students can choose that allows them to take college courses either in-person or online while simultaneously taking their normal high school classes. This allows the student to work towards their high school diploma while also working towards a collegiate degree.

The <strong>Dual Enrollment Program</strong> offered at Seminole State College allows students who qualify to take authentic college classes. Students can earn credit for high school and college simultaneously with the program! This credit can go towards an <strong>Associate in Arts (A.A)</strong> or an <strong>Associate in Science (A.S.)</strong> degree. Furthermore, students can work towards a career certificate at the same time.
                    
Students can choose two different paths for Dual Enrollment:
                    
The <strong>General Education</strong> path provides a route toward an Associate in Arts (A.A degree). The A.A is guaranteed and reinsured by Seminole State to transfer to any Florida public institution. An unweighted high school GPA of 3.0 is required to qualify for this program.
                    
The <strong>Career Path</strong> provides a route toward an Associate in Science (A.S) degree or a career certificate that can lead Students into an A.S degree in select programs such as Computers, business, Criminal Justice, etc. An unweighted high school GPA of 2.5 is required to qualify for this program.
                    
Students will have to take the P.E.R.T exam to see what classes they can be eligible for in the Dual Enrollment program.</p>
