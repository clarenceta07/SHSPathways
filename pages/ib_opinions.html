                <p>The #1 response was “work”, followed by similar terms such as “pain”, “hard”, and “stressful”.

Many of the responses shared a similarity with each other, mainly pertaining to some type of hardship or difficulty.
                    
There were some responses that described IB as “motivating”, “interesting”, and “supplemental”, but those kinds of responses were few and far between.</p>

            <h2>What is One Tip You Would Give to Incoming Freshmen?</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p><strong>Freshman</strong>: Make sure to manage your time wisely because there is more work than you are used to doing.

<strong>Sophomore</strong>: My one tip for IB is to have a positive mentality throughout IB because it makes getting through assignments so much easier.
                    
<strong>Junior</strong>: Try to make good friends. Make sure to surround yourself with helpful people that are driven students.
                    
<strong>Senior</strong>: As a freshman, one thing you should keep in mind is preparing for your high school future and beyond. Every senior realizes in their senior year just how quickly time flies and you are left wishing you had done more.</p>
