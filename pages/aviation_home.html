            <h2>What is Aviation Academy?</h2>
            <div class="text-content av">
                <p>The Aviation Academy is a program offered to students at Seminole High School who are interested in a career pathway related to aviation.</p>
                <div class="bullet-points-health">
                    <li>The Academy follows the Maintenance pathway or the Avionics pathway.</li>
                    <li>Students have an opportunity to get their private pilot license through this program.</li>
                    <li>The maintenance pathway in aviation begins with the Private Pilot Ground School course. This allows students to learn the required information that all pilots must know for final aircraft inspection. All core flight safety knowledge including airport markings, weather, and reading charts are taught throughout this course. After Ground School, students gain knowledge and experience in the inner workings of aircraft through Aviation Maintenance courses.</li>
                    <li>The Avionics pathway introduces students to the high-tech electronics systems onboard an aircraft, including flight control, navigation and communications. In the avionics academy, students will gain practical knowledge of wiring, electronics, and the correct use and care of power tools.</li>
                    <li>Anybody can enter Aviation Academy, however it is highly suggested that you speak to a counselor or academic advisor before a student enrolls into the academy.</li>
