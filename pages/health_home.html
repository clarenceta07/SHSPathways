            <h2>What is Health Academy?</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>The Health Academy program at Seminole High School offers students to start their journey in the medical world. Health academy allows students to receive training for 3 qualifications, including the <strong>Medical Assistant (CMA) Certification</strong>, the <strong>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Certification</strong> as well as a <strong>Certified Phlebotomy Technician (CPT)</strong>.

With hands-on experience, there are two pathways to the health academy course.
                    
The <strong>Patient Care Program</strong> is focused on providing students with hands-on patient care. It allows students to have a “solid foundation” for anyone seeking to pursue health careers directed at patients.
                    
The <strong>Biomedical Science</strong> program is focused on providing students with a foundation of knowledge, as well as oriented experience in the study of biomedical sciences. This includes studies related to the human body systems, medicine, biology concept, principles and far more.
                    
To specify more about the program, please check the additional information tab to see more about the program pathways.</p>

            <h2>Pros & Cons</h2>
            <div class="ib-pros">
                <p>Pros: </p>
                <ul class="bullet-points">
                    <li>Health Academy allows students to be exposed to the medical field early on.</li>
                    <li>Health career industry certification opportunities allow students to earn career certifications that make them “job-ready” as soon as the students graduate.</li>
                    <li>Lab spaces on campus allow students to practice & develop clinical skills.</li>
                    <li>Allows students to develop knowledge about medical subjects, and critical concepts, such as medical terminology.</li>
                    <li>Students can take pathways, leading them to work with real nurses at real nursing homes; this can lead students to get multiple certifications, giving them physical work experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="ib-cons">
                <p>Cons: </p>
                <ul class="bullet-points">
                    <li>It is very beneficial for students to make sure they want to enter the health world as a career choice. If you go through Health Academy and switch professions, you do not reap anywhere close to the benefits that health academy provides for students.</li>
                    <li>Students are held up to high expectations and responsibilities with real patients around their senior year in Health Academy. If students cannot follow with high responsibility, they will not succeed academically in the Health program.</li>
