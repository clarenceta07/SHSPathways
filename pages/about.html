             Our mission at SHSPathways is to aid rising high-school students coming into Seminole High School pick their course pathways. Seminole High School provides bountiful programs to choose from, and sometimes it is difficult to decide what is right for you. That is exactly why my partner, Tahmid Bhuyian, and I, Clarence Ta, decided to make a quick and easy resource to provide information on the programs offered at Seminole High School.
