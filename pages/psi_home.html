            <h2>WHAT IS PSI HIGH?</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>PSI High is a program that aims to break the “normal” high school course path by providing students with an outlet to let their imaginations run wild. Students are assigned year-long projects instead of exams in order to put less stress on the student and more emphasis on growth and creativity. Instead of handwriting and typing assignments, students will actually build new innovations such as a smart mirror, design a new school bus, and do more hands-on projects. Students have access to advanced technology such as iPads, Macbooks, 3-D printers, and even workshops fully kitted with materials. Compared to normal high school programs, PSI High receives a very large sum of funding, thus it is able to supply its students with state-of-the-art technology.</p>

            <h2>WHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE I START?</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Anyone and everyone can apply to PSI High, so expect a very diverse environment compared to perhaps your middle school. PSI forces students to be more creative instead of bleak, thus the assignments and projects require a motivated, and creative mindset in order to do well on them. Much of the technology PSI High provides might be new to most students, so expect it to take some time to adjust to the new environment. PSI High is on the 9th Grade Center, meaning that if you plan to take all four years of high school in PSI High, you will be on a freshmen-only campus even when you are a senior. This means that the people you meet in PSI High will be the people you spend all four years of high school with, and you can make of that as what you will.</p>
