            <h2>What are AP Courses?</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>AP courses are a type of class similar to honors classes, but more advanced than honors. At the end of each AP course, students will take an exam in May that covers information taught throughout the entire year. If you pass the AP exam for an AP course, then you will earn college credit, meaning that you can skip some of the required general education courses in college. AP courses range in a variety of different subjects from language to economics for instance. They also range in difficulty, with the easier courses being moderately easy for most and the most difficult courses only for those that are extremely dedicated to that subject. The AP exam ranges from 1 to 5, with a score of 3 or above considered passing and earning college credit. However, some of the more prestigious colleges will only accept scores of a 4 or 5, depending on the difficulty of the class. For instance, MIT only accepts credit for the AP Human Geography exam only if the student scores a 5. AP courses are a good course to take if you want to learn good habits for college and experience college-level testing.</p>

            <h2>Tips & Tricks for AP Courses</h2>
            <p>1. Start studying for the exam early than you would expect.</p>
            <li>Even if your teachers are still teaching new material, come March/April, you should start reviewing material from the beginning of the year.</li>
            <p>2. Use other resources besides the ones your teachers give you.</p>
            <li>For many AP courses, you can find entire YouTube channels dedicated to reviewing and teaching topics you learn in the class. (ex: Heimler’s History and Mr. Sinn)</li>
            <li>Publishers such as the Princeton Review will sell textbooks you can buy that have practice AP tests included.</li>
            <p>3. Do not take too many AP Courses.</p>
            <li>Some people take 5, 6, or even 7 AP courses in a year in order to boost their GPA. While there are some people who can handle this courseload, it is not the smartest idea for most people to take this many AP courses.</li>
            <p>4. Take the easier AP courses when you are an underclassman.</p>
            <li>Some good starter AP courses to take are AP Human Geography, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Psychology.</li>
